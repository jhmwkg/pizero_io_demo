# pizero_io_demo

This example is cobbled together from the following hardware/code:
https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-1-3-color-tft-bonnet-for-raspberry-pi/python-setup
https://learn.adafruit.com/lsm6ds33-6-dof-imu=accelerometer-gyro/python-circuitpython

And of course a Raspberry Pi Zero

Resulting graphic on the display will be two circular graphics.
The left one is for the accelerometer, a circle outline getting squished inside another circle outline.
The right one is for the gyroscope, a filled circle moving across a centerpoint to show direction of force.
